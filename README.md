# Activity vs. Structure phase diagram generator

First, run `get_logspace_weibull_variances.py` to generate a CSV file of variance - shape parameter values, logarithmically spaced in terms of variance. Then, `example.py` can be followed to see how to generate the networks and run the activity simulations. All of the simulation code itself is located in `weibull_networks.py`.
